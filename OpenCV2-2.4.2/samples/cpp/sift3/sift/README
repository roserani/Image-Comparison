This is a MATLAB/C implementation of the SIFT detector and descriptor
[1]. See the documentation in 'doc/' to get started.

COMPLING AND TESTING
  From MATLAB prompt
  > sift_compile
  > sift_demo
  > sift_demo2
  From shell prompt (Linux, Mac OS X)
  > make

ABOUT THE SOURCE CODE
  We use the follwing convention to name files:
  *.m *.c:       M and MEX files
  sift*mx.c:     `Private' MEX files 
  sift_*.m:      Service scripts (compiling, demos)

CHANGES
  0.9.2 Improved selection of keypoints too close to the boundary
  0.9.1 Fixed a bug in the creation of the .zip archive
  0.9   Fixed a bug for which some of the keypoint detected where
        dropped.

CREDITS
  The SIFT algorithm [1] has been patented by Dr. Lowe. Some of the
  images in 'data/' are from [2,3].
