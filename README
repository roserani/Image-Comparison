We are also malking use of SIFT algorithm patented.

We need to install the library to start the project.
Go the OpenCV/samples/cpp/descriptor_extractor_matcher.cpp to get the code

We are uploading part of the TestData.

The following is the way to compile the program.
Open the terminal and type the following //ensure that all libraries are included
//Make sure that opencv library version compatibale with ubuntu version you are using

g++ -I/usr/local/include/opencv -I/usr/local/include -ggdb `pkg-config --cflags opencv` -o `basename surf_keypoint_matcher.cpp .cpp` surf_keypoint_matcher.cpp `pkg-config --libs opencv`
